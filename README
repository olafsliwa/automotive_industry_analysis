# Analysis of the automotive industry in the context of energy sources  - data analysis project

## Main purpose of the analysis
Automotive industry faces challenges such as developing electric and autonomous vehicles. We have been observing this phenomenon for the last few years. Report presents how the trends mentioned above impact the overall structure of vehicles. The main purpose of this analysis is to show distribution of motor energy types of passenger cars in countries of the European Union. Thanks to the data which is publicly available on the Eurostat website, it is possible to compare number of vehicles with other variables such as GDP per capita, sources of energy supply and population.

## Steps taken
**•	Preparing data – uploading into MS Excel and transformation in PowerQuery**  
First step consist in uploading four tables with data which will be used in further analysis.
Using Power Query, data has been transformed through such actions as:
1. Removing columns that will be useless in the next stages
2. Filtering data. Keeping only information related to the subject of the analysis such us: time period (2015-2020 time period), countries (excluding groups of countries such as EU28 which stands from: European Union 28 countries), excluding totals and paying attention to correctness of the data (eliminating data marked as: break in time series, characterized as low reliability and information achieved in a process which differs from the ones established in the study).
3. Process of data transformation looks quite similar in all of the tables.

**•	Creating dimension tables**  
Next step focus on creating tables consisting of distinct abbreviations of: countries, motor energy and source of energy supply. It is easily obtainable by extracting uniqueness values and then creating columns which explain previous abbreviations.

**•	Creating table containing information about population, GDP and number of passenger cars**  
Formation of the table that holds data about the number of inhabitants, GDP per capita and number of cars will be useful in the further stages of the analysis and visualization. The main reason in the necessity to create calculated column which show number of cars per capita.


**•	Data model and final visualization**  
Results of the whole analysis are visible in the photos below. We can see data model created for the purposes of analysis and the final data visualization.
 

## Development directions
There is always room for improvements, which allow to find more compelling conclusions. In order to achieving deeper analysis, interesting solutions would be to expand analyzed data by set of different information such as employment rate of automotive sector.

## Data source
Datasets uses in the analysis which has been described above, come from Eurostat, which is one the biggest institution gathering statistical data in the European Union. Information can be found by clicking on the links below:
